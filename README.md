# 🍽️ Favourite Meals App (React Native + Expo)

A learning project built with **React Native** and **Expo**, where I explored the fundamentals of mobile app development, navigation, and state management in React.

This app allows users to browse a list of meals, view details, and mark their favourites.  
It was designed as a personal learning project, but it also serves as a solid starter template for anyone beginning their React Native journey.

This project was my **entry point into the React Native world**.  
Some of the key concepts and tools I learned while building this:

### 🖌️ React Native UI Elements
- `View`, `Text`, `Pressable`
- `FlatList`, `ScrollView`
- `StatusBar`, `SafeAreaView`

### 🧭 Navigation
- `react-navigation`
- Stack Navigator
- Drawer Navigator
- Combining navigation types for a better UX

### ⚛️ React Concepts Refreshed
- **State management** with `useState`
- **Context API** for global state
- **useLayoutEffect** for customizing screen headers dynamically
